# SOCD - Last Input Priority
AutoHotKey v.2.0 Script for Last Input Priority SOCD Resolution on Keyboard

## What is SOCD / Last Input Priority?
SOCD means "Simultaneous Opposing Cardinal Directions." It is the physical actuation of cardinal directions that are separate and opposite to each other - ie, pressing Left and Right at the same time. Basically, it's how 'left' and 'right' inputs are handled when both keys are pressed at the same time.
In most cases, both directions are not initially actuated at the same time. When the second (or most recent) direction you pressed in the SOCD overrides the first, it is called Last Input Priority Resolution.

Ex:
Holding 'A' (character already moving left) then pressing 'D' = Character will move right until D is released. NORMALLY this would result in a 'neutral' input.
